Database Learning Project
Overview
This project is dedicated to learning and practicing advanced SQL concepts.
Since I cannot install a full DBMS on my work laptop, I’m using SQLite as a lightweight alternative. While I typically default to PostgreSQL and MSQL, SQLite is sufficient for the purpose of experimenting with queries and deepening my understanding of SQL.
Database Setup
- The database consists of 10 tables, generated with the help of AI to provide a structured environment for practice.
- I use the create_tables script as a starting point, then ask AI to generate tasks or challenges based on the schema.
- This approach allows me to focus on query writing and problem-solving rather than schema design.
Workflow
- Initially, I worked directly within SQLite.
- To better organize and revisit my work, I’m now moving everything into VS Code, where I’ll store all queries in files.
- This setup makes it easier to track progress, refine queries, and build a personal library of SQL exercises.
Purpose
This repository is not production-ready code.
Its sole purpose is:
- Practicing advanced SQL beyond the basics (SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...).
- Building confidence with complex queries, joins, subqueries, window functions, and other advanced features.
- Creating a personal reference of solved problems and techniques.
